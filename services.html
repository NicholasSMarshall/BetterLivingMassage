            Cupping is a therapeutic add-on service that involves creating negative pressure inside a cup, which 
            gently draws the skin upward and separates layers of superficial fascia. This technique helps bring 
            old blood and cellular debris to the surface, encouraging fresh circulation in the area. The round 
            marks left behind are often mistaken for bruises but are a natural and temporary result of the process.

            Hot Stone Massage is a therapeutic add-on service that uses smooth, heated basalt river rocks to help 
            relax tense muscles, improve circulation, and restore soft tissue function. The stones are placed on 
            specific areas of the body and may also be used during the massage to apply deeper, soothing pressure, 
            enhancing the overall sense of relaxation and relief.
