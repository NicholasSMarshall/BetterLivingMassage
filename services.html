            old blood and cellular debris to the surface, encouraging fresh circulation in the area. The round 
            marks left behind are often mistaken for bruises but are a natural and temporary result of the process.

            A hot stone massage is a distinctive type of massage that can help you relax and alleviate tense muscles, 
            enhance circulation, and revitalize damaged soft tissues in your body. This form of massage requires the 
            use of basalt River rocks, which are placed on various points of your body. Before being used, the rocks 
            are heated and can be applied to target specific areas.
